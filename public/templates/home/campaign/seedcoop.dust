    <p>Help us build a foundation for the platform cooperative movement.</p>

		<p>The mission of the project is to help birth a new generation of cooperatives using crowdfunding technology that enables supporters to seed cooperatives with members and fresh capital.</p>

		<p>Our plan is to help usher in a new era of social venture funding where investments are people-powered and our economic systems are cooperatively owned.</p>

					<h3>Seed Coop</h3>
					<p>Seed.coop is itself in the process of being organized as a cooperatively owned fundraising platform guided by a steering committee committed to economic justice and sustainability. A healthy portion of the proceeds from the Seed.Coop platform's activities will be reinvested into cooperative ventures selected for funding by the members of the cooperative themselves. The balance of funds will be used to support the development and maintenance of the Seed.Coop open-source platform. Initially, funds raised in the name of Seed.coop, will be held in Trust by CoLab.Coop for future use by Seed.coop upon its timely formation.</p>
